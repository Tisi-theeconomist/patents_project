"Apparatus, method, and system for high capacity band brake type variable friction damping of movement of structures",9896836,utility,2018-02-20,"Implementation of high performance controllable damping devices can ameliorate cost-effectiveness of structural systems for mitigation of natural hazards relative to structures such as building, wind turbines, and off-shore structures. However, the applications of these damping systems are limited due to a lack of 1) mechanical robustness; 2) electrical reliability; and 3) large resisting force capability. To broaden the implementation of modern damping systems, a semi-active damping device is proposed. The device, in one form termed Banded Rotary Friction Device (BRFD), has enhanced applicability compared to other proposed damping systems due to its cost-effectiveness, high damping performance, mechanical robustness, and technological simplicity. Its mechanical principle is based on a band brake, which results in a high amplification of the input force while enabling a variable control force.",org_mLi08NQ1mp1abBn7WwlW,US,42.0347,-93.6197,Ames,42.0347,-93.6197,Ames,US,9896836-1,org_mLi08NQ1mp1abBn7WwlW,"Iowa State University Research Foundation, Inc.",2.0,1099.0

Roof ridge wind turbine,9915242,utility,2018-03-13,Disclosed are systems and method that generally relate to the capture of wind energy by small wind turbines mounted on buildings with gabled roofs. Wind energy harnessing system for gabled roof buildings having a roof ridge including a low silhouette visually appealing enclosure mounted along the roof ridge of a building and extending down both sides of the roof forming the ridge. The enclosure includes airflow guides defined by columns extending down a length of both sides of the building roof forming sidewalk and a roof formed of pivoting louvers above the columns. A paddle-wheel type wind turbine consists of a multiple-bladed cylindrical shaft that contacts the wind and provides rotational work mounted within the enclosure and a generator connected to the wind turbine for converting the rotational work from the wind turbine to electrical energy. The enclosure for the wind turbine functions to capture wind and directs the airflow via the airflow guides before it reaches the ridge.,org_Q62sXsbrz5MPtXi4BnFf,US,41.5119,-82.9378,Port Clinton,39.1856,-78.1636,Winchester,US,7199088-1,org_Q62sXsbrz5MPtXi4BnFf,TURBOROOF LLC,2.0,1.0
