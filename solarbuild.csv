The fluid that cools the photovoltaic devices can be used for building heat, home hot water or industrial process heat. The frame shields the reflectors from ambient wind loads, supports reflector axles accurately and simplifies installation on roofs or walls of buildings. The frame, reflectors, absorber and ancillary components comprise a module that can be shipped, installed and operated by low skill. Most components are fabricated using “double wall” construction formed by two face sheets held apart by a core that reduces their weight and their cost. Reflector surfaces are curved to focus the sun and to provide additional strength. Module design includes methods to install, maintain and verify proper functioning of the modules. In addition, methods show how electrical energy can be derived from the module, both circulating fluids that power thermodynamic engines and by photovoltaic cells that are cooled by the circulating fluid. Sensors contained in the modules detect aberrant behavior and optimize reflector trajectories to extract the most solar heat available. Communication between modules allows optimization of an array of modules.",,,,,,32.3122,-106.77799999999999,Las Cruces,US,4677852-2,,,,

Preferably such lenses separated by non-transparent intervening spaces are concave lenses with a radius of curvature which is less than the radius of curvature of convex lenses, on the other surface, causing the concave lens focal length to be less than, typically about one-half of, the focal length of the convex lenses. The thickness of the sheet and hence the spacing between each concave lens and a corresponding convex lens causes the lenses axial spacing to be about the difference in focal lengths of the lenses producing the effect of a tiny Galilean telescope.

The system is comprised of three major subsystems: (1) a light collector array, (2) a mechanical thermo-voltaic generator, and (3) a storage and retrieval system. At the center of the system is the light collection array comprised of solar collector elements. These collector elements are connected to optical conduits (fiber optic cables) that carry the light energy to a mechanical generator. An automatic aiming system is used to align the collector elements directly at a light source for maximum light output. Each light collector element is comprised of a set of lenses that focus a larger area of light down to a point small enough to inject into an optical conduit. The optical conduit is then used to carry the light from each collector element to the generator. The system can use either a steam turbine or a Stirling engine type of mechanical generator, which is connected to a standard AC generator for generating electrical power. The heating chamber involves an outer shell where the optical conduits attach and allows the light to shine through to the heating area of either the boiler of a steam turbine or the hot node of a Stirling engine. Additionally, a small hole is provided in the bottom of the heating chamber where a gas burner is mounted to provide an auxiliary means of providing heat to the system. The burner can be fueled by natural gas or from stored hydrogen from the system. Electricity from the system that is not used immediately is redirected to a storage unit, such as a bank of batteries. In the system, electricity can be taken directly form the generator or can be used to charge the batteries and taken from them when needed.
